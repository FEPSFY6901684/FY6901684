This article discusses the topic of time travel: its perception throughout history, and plausibility in theoretical physics. 'Time' has evolved past its previous interpretation as fixed and absolute in Newtonian physics to potentially existing as a 4th dimension 
with the Einstein's theories of relativity. While it is mathematically possible given some models of how our universe works, ignoring the 
technological limitations, time travel raises logical inconsistencies that could limit its realistic plausibility; exemplified most by, "The Grandfather Paradox,"
which challenge the fundamental nature of physics/ causality. By examining theories of resolution such as "Novikov's self-consistency principle," and 
Hugh Everet's, "Many Worlds Interpretation," this article can help serve as an insight into the complex weave of time travel and real-world possibility.

 <h3 class="headings1"><b>  1. Introduction </b></h3>

</heading>


<h4 class="baseline">
<div>
Time travel; the hypothetical activity of traversing into the past or future. 
It is a concept that has entertained the minds of both scientists and non-scientists alike. 
As our understanding of technology advances, the notion of time travel grows increasingly attractive. 
Having often appearing in numerous forms of popular-media - but is it just fiction? The answer: No, but with a heavy asterisk involved.
Albert Einstein's proposed theory of general relativity, though incomplete, suggests that with suitable conditions; time travel, past and future, is mathematically possible <span class="citations">(Smeenk et al., 2023).</span>
However, before we even fathom as to how those conditions could be met, there are paradoxical inconsistencies that limit the possibility of time travel, 
posing questions and threats to the laws of causality and our grasp of physics. This article seeks to describe those limitations, such as the "Grandfather Paradox,"
and review how humanities' theories attempt to resolve them.

  <h3 class="headings1"><b>  2. Time Across Time </b></h3>
 
 </heading>
 
 
 <h4 class="baseline">
 <div>
  The concept of 'time' was considered to be absolute and universal; based off our understanding of Newtonian/ classical mechanics, time was constant and 
  flowed equally everywhere <span class="citations">(Newton, 1687, Scholium to the Definitions)</span>. Newton's work stood on firm foundations for a long time, his laws accurately describing 
  our universe for what was visible; however, as the field evolved, the scale (both micro, and macro) of our observational capability increased 
  as well - observations that raised discrepancies in Newtonian mechanics. Our theory has limitations. Anomalies improperly explained by Newton's theory, 
  such as the orbit of mercury, an anomaly that served as motivation for cue: Albert Einstein - renown as, not just physics', but one of history's most laureate minds, 
  and soon-forth the development of general relativity. Along with that, the idea of 'spacetime' and 'closed timelike curves' (CTCs) was born <span class="citations">(Einstein, 1916).</span>

  <h3 class="headings1"><b>  3. One of Many Challenges </b></h3>
 
 </heading>
 
 
 <h4 class="baseline">
 <div>
  Theoretically possible, and realistically possible are extremely black and white; if humanity were to somehow overcome the technological limitations of time travel, 
  core principles of physics would have to be challenged. While paradoxes tend to border between the brinks of philosophy and science, 
  if the structure of CTCs are mathematically possible, and to be taken seriously, inconsistencies that arise from their existence require solutions. 
  The first and most well-known of these paradoxes: <b>'The Grandfather Paradox.'</b> The scenario depicts a fundamental threat to causality within physics; 
  it describes a time traveller going to the past and preventing their grandparents from ever meeting. Henceforth, 
  preventing the time traveller from begin born and preventing the grandparents from having not met <span class="citations">(Nicholas J.J., 2024)</span>.

  <h3 class="headings1"><b>  4. Possible Solutions </b></h3>
 
 </heading>
 
 <h4 class="baseline">
 <div>
  <p><b>4.1. Novikov Self-Consistency Principle:</b></p>
  Internal contradictions, like the one depicted within these paradoxes, render many to deem time travel to be a logical impossibility; 
  however, such a conclusion would logically invalidate Einstein's theory of general relativity too. Influencing one's past influences their future as well; 
  is it impossible then? Maybe. Due to Einstein's contributions to the field, the possibility of time travel has garnered serious attention, 
  some seeking to rectify these problems. Russian scientist, <i>'Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov,'</i> proposed the now <i>"Novikov self-consistency principle,"</i>
  in the mid 1980s. Intended to resolve paradoxes in time travel, Novikov's <span class="citations">(1998, ch.6)</span> conjecture expresses: <i>'if an event exists that would give rise to a paradox, 
  or to any "change" to the past whatsoever, then the probability of that event is zero.'</i> - that in some inexplicable way, 
  the time traveller will have failed to alter the past's events. This way, the principle remains self-servient, actions becoming part of history all along, as a result, 
  it uses predestination to avoid paradoxical alteration.  
 </div>

 <br>

 <div>
  <p><b>4.2. Many Worlds Interpretation:</b></p>
  Another possible resolution is a subvariant of 'Hugh Everett's,' 'Many-Worlds Interpretation,' (MWI); touching into the world of quantum mechanics, 
  the MWI describes a time traveller arriving in a different universe from whence they came at that point in time. 
  Every possible action suspended in a state of superposition, only converging upon certainty in order to maintain a consistent timeline; 
  actions that diverge cause a 'split' in that timeline, creating its own mutually exclusive universe <span class="citations">(Kok, 2013)</span>. 
  Surface-level criticism to this explanation has arisen as this would not constitute as 'real time travel' since the paradox is only avoided due to it 'technically'
  not having happened in the first place <span class="citations">(Smeenk et al., 2023)</span>. While not being the film-quality form of time travel as desired, the MWI does provide a plausible, 
  logical reasoning to avoid the 'Grandfather Paradox,' altering the past may be unfeasible; but silver lining: you still time travelled.

  <h3 class="headings1"><b>  5. Conclusion </b></h3>
 
 </heading>
 
 
 <h4 class="baseline">
 <div>
  This remains one of the fields most elusive problems awaiting to be solved; the theories of which best describes our universe require unification as the concept of 
  time-travel may be possible within the realm of relativity but is still not strictly prohibited by our current knowledge of quantum mechanics <span class="citations">(Isham, C.J.)</span>.
  Current theories lawfully permitting time travel are still just theories; and for a topic as abstract as 'time travel,' rigorously testing for proof remains 
  inconclusive - bordering on implausible for some already. Furthermore, continuing to discount the technological feasibility, there are still other paradoxes - such 
  as the bootstrap paradox - that require explanation unto themselves. Is it impossible then? Potentially, potentially not. The possibility of time travel, I imagine, 
  is improbable to fade away from the minds of physicists and philosophers; even just as being a cornerstone in the world of science-fiction, curiosity and passion for 
  t remains. Until the unlikely event we 'master' the physical world around us, continuous theories of time travel shenanigans will still be thought of and formed.
